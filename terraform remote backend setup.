☁️ Terraform Remote Backend
Using a remote backend like AWS S3 + DynamoDB helps teams collaborate securely. It enables:

Shared, version-controlled state file

State locking with DynamoDB

Safe CI/CD practices in production.

=========================================================================================

Make sure the S3 bucket exist before running terraform init.

ex:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"                -------------------># Create the bucket Manually.
    key            = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
